My experimental react boilerplate.

Inspired by https://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html#the-client-application

Uses flow + react + redux + webpack + yarn

All the boilerplates I have seen have been giant and I didn't understand squat. So I made my own, learning redux and react along the way, using the tutorial above.

I am still learning so it might be somewhat weird. The whole ecosystem is sooo complex.
