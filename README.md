My experiment with comics, extracted from supermegamonkey.

I am using it for keeping track of which comics I have and haven't read.

I used it for learning React+Redux.

An example: Search for all books, that have either Wolverine and Spider-Man, or Wolverine and Iron Fist.

Search for all books that have Steve Ditko credit

Note that the index ends up in 1993; from the time it was scraped from SMM.
